@theme @theme_ucsf @theme_ucsf_backtotop
Feature: Back-to-top button
  In order to efficiently navigate the site
  As a moodle user
  I need to be able to quickly jump back to the top of the page after having scrolled below the fold

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username |
      | student1 |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname |
      | Course 1 | C1        |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role    |
      | student1 | C1     | student |

  @javascript
  Scenario: Back-to-top button - is visible and works
    Given the theme cache is purged and the theme is reloaded
    When I log in as "student1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    Then "#back-to-top" "css_element" should exist
    And "#page-footer" "css_element" should appear before "#back-to-top" "css_element"
    And "#back-to-top" "css_element" should not be visible
    And I scroll page to x "0" y "250"
    And "#back-to-top" "css_element" should be visible
    And I click on "#back-to-top" "css_element"
    # Then I wait 1 second as the scroll up process is animated
    And I wait "1" seconds
    And "#back-to-top" "css_element" should not be visible
